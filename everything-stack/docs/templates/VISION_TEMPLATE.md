# Vision Template

Work through these questions conversationally. This isn't a form to fill - it's a discovery process. The goal is clarity on WHY this project exists.

---

## The Problem

What pain exists in the world that this project addresses?

*Don't describe your solution. Describe the problem as someone experiencing it would describe it.*

**Prompts:**
- Who feels this pain?
- How do they currently cope?
- What's the cost of the status quo?
- Why hasn't this been solved already?

---

## The Solution

How does this project address the problem?

*High-level approach, not features. What's the core insight that makes this work?*

**Prompts:**
- What's the key unlock?
- Why will this work when previous attempts haven't?
- What's the simplest version that still solves the problem?

---

## Success Criteria

How will we know this project succeeded?

*Concrete, measurable where possible. What would make you proud?*

**Prompts:**
- In 6 months, what would make this a win?
- What behavior change are we hoping to see?
- What would users say about it?

---

## Users

Who is this for?

*Be specific. "Everyone" is not an answer.*

**Prompts:**
- Who is the first user?
- What context are they in when they use this?
- What do they care about that we must get right?
- Who is explicitly NOT a target user?

---

## Non-Goals

What are we NOT building?

*Boundaries prevent scope creep. Be explicit about what's out.*

**Prompts:**
- What features might people expect that we won't include?
- What adjacent problems will we ignore?
- What quality level is acceptable for v1?

---

## Constraints

What can't change?

*Technical, business, personal constraints that bound the solution space.*

**Prompts:**
- What tech stack decisions are locked?
- What timeline exists?
- What resources are available?
- What must be true for you to stay motivated?

---

## Open Questions

What don't we know yet?

*Uncertainty is fine. Name it so we can address it.*

# After Discovery

Once these questions feel answered, crystallize into `VISION.md`:

- Problem statement (2-3 sentences)
- Solution approach (2-3 sentences)
- Success criteria (3-5 bullets)
- Primary user persona (1 paragraph)
- Non-goals (3-5 bullets)
- Key constraints (list)
