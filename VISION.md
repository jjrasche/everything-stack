# Vision

## What is this?

A template repository for building cross-platform apps. Clone it, add your domain logic, ship everywhere.

Includes a working notes app that demonstrates all patterns: entities, mixins, repository, offline-first sync, auth, semantic search.

## Why does it exist?

Prove that AI can autonomously build software when given clear contracts and governance infrastructure.

Prove that one codebase can ship to mobile, web, and desktop with offline-first, sync, and collaboration built in.

## What does success look like?

1. Clone repo, configure credentials, deploy working notes app in under an hour
2. Add a new entity type by following the Note pattern
3. AI implements features from BDD scenarios without human coding
4. Governance loop works: scenarios -> implementation -> tests -> deploy -> verify

## Who is it for?

Developers who want to build apps without writing all the code. They define behavior, AI implements.

## What is it NOT?

- Not a framework to learn
- Not a boilerplate with empty folders
- Not something that works "eventually" - the template itself must be deployable
